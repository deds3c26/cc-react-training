    <p>A paragraph contains a group of sentences intertwined with each other to discuss, or debate, or explain a central
        idea.
        It conventionally begins with an indented line. A beginner writer or a student usually starts writing a
        <b>paragraph</b> having seven sentences, while some professors of composition advise beginners to start with
        nine
        sentences,
        and some others ask them to start with eleven sentences. Some, however, teach all three paragraph types step by
        step.
